* My script directory

  This is the cozy nest for my scripts, to be used in conjunction with
  https://github.com/ianthehenry/sd.

** Getting started

   * Install sd according to https://github.com/ianthehenry/sd.
   * Symlink the this directory somewhere
     e.g. ~ln -s ~/dotfiles/scripts ~/scripts~
   * Update SD_ROOT env var to that location
     e.g. ~echo SD_ROOT=~/scripts > ~/.zshrc~
